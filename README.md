# Recipe Dashboard
Created a simple Recipe Search Dashboard with TDD in mind! I did my best to adhere to this but found myself slipping back to BDD naturally. I also focused on trying to optimize performance though use of useCallback, useMemo and React.memo where appropriate. I just need to finish two small things then I feel like this is done!

# Left To Do
1) Make Loading Spinner Component
2) Merge state as shown here for axios requests : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53574614/multiple-calls-to-state-updater-from-usestate-in-component-causes-multiple-re-re
