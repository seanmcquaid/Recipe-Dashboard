# Recipe Dashboard
Creating a Recipe Dashboard using TDD as a practice. I am trying to do this as quickly and effectively as possible. In that spirit, I will most likely allow myself two nights after work to work on this.

# Requirements - MVP
1) User should be able to search for recipe by ingredient name - done
2) The table row contains the recipe name + a link button that takes the user to another page with recipe info - done
3) Recipe info page contains recipe + options to change from US to metric
4) User should be able to select how many results to get back - default to 10
5) Performance Enhancement to code as needed

# Stretch
1) Add additional ways to query / search besides just a recipe
